# Donate

Generate donations to projects you want to support according to a distribution
you control.

## About
### The Problem

I want to donate to many (mostly software) projects which I like, use or depend
on. This creates a tension between what donation strategy would suit me and what
would suit those projects.

Because there are many projects, if I regularly donate a reasonable amount to
each I will be spending more money than I am comfortable with. However, if I
split the amount I am comfortable with between all the projects then each will
receive a tiny amount and loose (proportionally) more of my contributions
through payment-service and currency transactions fees. Also, I may value some
projects more than others and want them to receive a greater share.

### A Possible Solution

Donate lets the user set,

1. The total amount they want to regularly donate
1. How many projects this will be split between (and hence the individual
   donation amount)
1. A collection of recipients with a weighting to favour their favourite or most
   important projects

This ensure that the user can donate an amount they are happy with, weighted
as they like and that the individual donations will be significant.

### New Problems

This system is certainly not perfect. Here are some problems I can see,

- Making donations requires discipline and manual intervention, unlike services
  like [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/)
- The amounts and regularity at which projects will receive donations is
  unpredictable which could make their financial planning more difficult

| `donees`           | List of donees                                     | yes      |          |
